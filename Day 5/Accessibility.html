    <h1>Accessibility</h1>

    <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0—published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)—are widely regarded internationally as the most authoritative source of web accessibility guidelines around the world, and in fact was accepted as an International Standards Organization (ISO) standard in 2012 (ISO/IEC 40500:2012). The WCAG 2.0 guidelines are technology-agnostic, meaning that the authors intended the guidelines to be applicable across all current and future web technologies: HTML, PDF, Java, Flash, Silverlight, video players, and so on.</p>

    <h2>The 4 Main Principles</h2>
	<p>The main accessibility principles identified in WCAG 2.0 are:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Perceivable:</li>
	Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. [Ensure content is accessible to people who are blind and/or deaf.]
	<li> Operable:</li>
	User interface components and navigation must be operable. 
	[Make sure all features are accessible by keyboard; not just by mouse.]
	<li> Understandable</li>
	Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
	<li> Robust</li>
	Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
	</ol>

    <h2>Accessibility in Uganda</h2>
    <p>From a draft of information and communication technology accessibility Guideline: <br>
    <br>
    The goal of web accessibility policy should be to remove barriers persons with disabilities face in using websites. For example, people who are blind or with low vision require websites that are compatible with screen readers that read text aloud; provide text alternatives for images which describe images; allow for resizing of text, images and page layouts and provide alternative web navigation aids. People who are deaf or hard of hearing will require captions for any content that is spoken, including videos, media players and web applications (apps). People with mobility disabilities may require additional time to complete tasks on a website and streamlined and keyboard-only compatible navigation mechanisms and page functions allowing use of alternative input devices.</p>
