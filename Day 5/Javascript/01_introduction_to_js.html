    <h1>Javascript basics</h1>
    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
    <p>HTM and CSS are called <em>markup languages</em>. They describe certain elemetns of a document. Javascript is a <em>programming language</em>. It allows you to change elements on the page based on user actions. Just like HTML and CSS, you can write javascript in notepad, and it will run in . your browser.</p>

    <h2>The language</h2>
    <p>Javascript has some new qualities that are part of most programming languages. We'll discuss two of them, variables and functions.</p>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>A variable is something you define in your program that can store a number or word that can change over time. Think of it like a backpack. You might have a computer in a backpack, or a shirt, or some food. you can change the contents whenever you like. variables are used by programmers to store and change data over time.</p>
    <p>You write a vaiable in javascript like this</p>
    <pre><code>var myVariableName = somevalue ; </code></pre>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>Functions are blocks of code that do one thing. You <em>invoke</em> a function by calling its name when an event happens. Web evenets might be selecting a button, loading a page, or entering text into a field. When you write a fucntion, it becomes a collection of code that you can reuse over and over again.</p>
    <p>You write a function in javascript like this</p>
    <pre><code>
function myFunction() {
}</code></pre>
    <p>Your code to execute a change in the page would go inside the braces.</p>
