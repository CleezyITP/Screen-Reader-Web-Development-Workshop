    <h1>Hello HTML</h1>
    
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language, referred to as HTML, is the fundamental language of the web. You can think of it as the "skeleton" of a website. It declares the structure of a page and contains the text. This very page you're reading now is written in HTML, as are all webpages you've read.</p>

    <h2>The index page</h2>
    <p>Websites have a special file for the first page you come to on a site. When you visit google.com or yahoo.com, or any domain at all, you're actually accessing a file named <em>index.html</em>.</p>
    <p>We'll make this index page in a few minutes, but first let's look at the structure of HTML, the markup language we'll be using.</p>
    
    <h2>HTML structure</h2>
    <p>HTML defines the structure of your webpages. The language contains <em>elements</em> that are typically comprised of two <em>tags</em>. One opening tag and one closing tag. Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that is inside two tags.
        
        As we mentioned earlier, it's useful to think of HTML as the bones of your site. Just like you, HTML contains a head and a body.</p><p>Tags are like containers for content. They surround the things they describe.</p> <p><a href="01a_example_HTML.html">here is a small sample of HTML</a></p>
