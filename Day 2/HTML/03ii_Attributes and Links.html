    <h1>Attributes and Links</h1>

 <h2>Attributes</h2>

 <p>Attributes are used to modify elements. Attributes are used in a number of ways and are useful when adding links, images, accessibility, adding style with CSS and interactions with Javascript. Today, we are going to use them to create links.</p>

 <h2>Links</h2>

<p> Links are created by using the <em>anchor</em> element. There are many different kinds of links you can make. For example, you can link to an email address, an image, or some other service. For now we'll stick with linking to another page. <a href="03e_links.html">link example</a></li>
