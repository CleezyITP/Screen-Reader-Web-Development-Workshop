    <h1>Multi page sites</h1>
    
    <p>Making a web page is cool, but it's a lot more interesting when you can link to other pages. When you start to think of a larger site, one that has many pages with different kinds of content on each, you should plan how these files are organized. This is called your <em>site map</em>. The map should have content of similar kinds matched up together. That is, pages of a certain type should go in a folder together, images should go in a folder together, scripts and CSS files in their own folders too.</p><p>This is helpful in clearly determining what the content is for your site.</p>
