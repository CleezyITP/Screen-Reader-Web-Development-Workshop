    <h1>How websites are created</h1>
    <h2>What is rendered</h2>
    <p>Your browser receives HTML, CSS and other files from the web server where the site is hosted. The browser interpets the data and creates a page you can access. The rendering also places video, audio and interactive elements on the page. </p>
    <h2>Languages of the web</h2>
    <p>There is one fundamental language on the web, and two others that support and expand it extensively. These are HTML, CSS, and Javaacript. We'll discuss the specifics of these over the next week, but this is a broad overview.</p>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the core language of the web. You can think of it as the "skeleton" of a website. It declares the structure onf the page, and contains the text. This very page you're reading now is written in HTML, as are all webpages you've read.</p>
        
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language</p>
    
    <h3>Javascript</h3>
    <p>Javascript is the soul of the web.</p>
