    <h1>Hello HTML</h1>
    <h2>The index page</h2>
    <p>Websites have a special file for the first page you come to on a site. When you visit google.com or yahoo.com, or any domain at all, you're actually accessing a file named <em>index.html</em>.</p>
    <p>We'll make this index page in a few minutes, but first let's look at the structure of HTML, the markup language we'll be using.</p>
    <h2>HTML structure</h2>
    <p>HTML defines the structure of your webpages. The language contains <em>elements</em> that are typically comprised of two <em>tags</em>. One opening tag and one closing tag. Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that is inside two tags.
        
        As we mentioned earlier, it's useful to think of HTML as the bones of your site. Just like you, HTML contains a head and a body.</p><p>Tags are like containers for content. They surround the things they describe.</p> <p>Below is text for a sample HTML page.</p>
        <h2>example HTML code</h2>

    <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;    
    &lt;/head&gt;  
    &lt;body&gt;   
        &lt;p&gt;This is my site!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;   
&lt;/html&gt;   
    </pre>

<h2>What all that stuff means</h2>

    <p>Computers need exact instructions. Code languages are just like a recipe, or set of instructions. If your computer doesn’t understand something because of a typo or incorrect use of code, it can’t do what you wish. If you do not understand something, you can always ask someone, but computers are less forgiving.</p>

    <p>The text above is a very simple webpage using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). <a href="01_example.html">This how the page is actually rendered</a></p><p>The elements inside the less-than and greater-than symbols are HTML tags. In this page, you can see the <em>html</em>, <em>head</em>, <em>title</em>, <em>body</em>, and <em>p</em> tags. Let's address these individually.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>html</strong> - This element goes at the beginning of every HTML page. It is closed with /html when you're finished with the file</li>
        <li><strong>head</strong> - This part of the file will contain information like the site's title, and any additional files you want to use, like CSS or javascript.</li> 
         <li><strong>title</strong> - This is the title of your webpage. The title tag, and it's closing tag, are between the head and the /head tags. Your screen reader will read the title of a page when it loads, but it is not displayed on the screen.</li>
         <li><strong>body</strong> - The body contains the content you will read off the screen. It is where you will put the majority of your content, text, audio, video, images, links, and so on. </li>
        <li><strong>p</strong> - This is a paragrapgh tag. Text will go between the two p tags (opening and closing) and will be displayed in the main browser window.</li>
    </ul>
