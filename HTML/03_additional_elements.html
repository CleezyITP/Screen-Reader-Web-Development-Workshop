    <h1>Some other HTML elements that are useful</h1>
    <p>You've seen how a website comes together with tags that describe the page's structure. The head and body tags provide a framework for you to add information in a logical fashion, and the p tag identifies a paragraph of text in the website. Let's look at some other elements that describe text in the page</p>
    <p>To review at the HTML of these examples, you can view the source of the pages (Command F12)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>h1</strong> - HTML had six different kinds of <em>headings</em> to structure text on a page. h1 is for top level items, like the title of a page. You probably only want to use this once per page. <a href="03a_h1.html">h1 example</a></li>

        <li><strong>h2 h3 h4 h5 h6</strong> - each of these headings describes a different level of content. You can use these as much and as often as you like, but they should follow in order, that is, h3 will come under h2, and h2 will come under h1. your screen reader identifies each level as living under the one above it, so it's important to keep these structured. <a href="03b_h2_h6.html">h2 through h6 example</a> </li>

        <li><strong>ul</strong> - this element identifies that an <em>unordered list</em> is going to follow. A list is made up of any number of items. <a href="03c_ul.html">unordered list example</a></li>

        <li><strong>ol</strong> - this element identifies that an <em>ordered list</em> is going to follow. this type of list will automatically add an ascending number to each element in the list.<a href="03d_ol.html">ordered list example</a></li>

        <li><strong>li</strong> - this identifies a <em>list item</em>, or one element of a list.</li>

        <li><strong>strong</strong> - This identifies a selection of text that has a <em>strong</em> importance</li>

        <li><strong>em</strong> - this identifies a section of text that should be <em>emphasized</em></li>

        <li><strong>a</strong> - this is the <em>anchor</em> element, and it is used for creating links in a web page. There are many different kinds of links you can make, but for now we'll stick with linking to another page (instead of an email address, or an image, or some other service) <a href="03e_links.html">link example</a></li>

        <li><strong>comments</strong> - You can leave notes for yourself in HTML that the browser will ignore, and won't be rendered on the page. <a href="03f_comments.html">example with comments</a></li>
    </ul>
