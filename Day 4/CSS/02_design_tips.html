    <h1> CSS tips </h1>
    <p>  While CSS won't change the way you read the page, to a sighted person it can have a large impact on usability. There are some general things to keep in mind when designing a site with CSS.</p>
    
    
    <ul> 
        <li>If a page has a lot of text, san serif fonts are generally easier to read than serifed fonts. By default, browsers will render text serifed, you may want to change this.</li>
        <li>It is possible to align text to the left side, right side, or centered on a page. For english, paragraph text is usually alighned on the left. If you want to center something, it's usually best done with headings or short sentences. </li>
        <li>Readbility is enhanced when proper punctuation a and capitalization is used. Similarly, you shouldn't write in all caps or in bold text all the time. On the internet, people read this as yelling.</li></ul>
