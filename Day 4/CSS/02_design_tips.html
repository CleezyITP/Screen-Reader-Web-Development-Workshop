    <h1> CSS tips </h1>
    <p>  While CSS won't change the way you read the page, to a sighted person it can have a large impact on usability. There are some general things to keep in mind when designing a site with CSS. </p>
    
    <ul>         
        <li>If a page has a lot of text, san serif fonts are generally easier to read than serifed fonts. By default, browsers will render text serifed, you may want to change this.</li>
        <li>It is possible to align text to the left side, right side, or center it on a page. For English, paragraph text is usually aligned on the left. If you want to center something, it's usually best done with headings or short sentences. </li>
        <li>Readability is enhanced when proper punctuation and capitalization is used. Similarly, you shouldn't write in all caps or in bold text all the time. On the internet, people read this as yelling.</li>
        <li>If you're going to use multiple colors for your background and text, you should ask a sighted person to help you pick colors that work well together.</li>
    </ul>
