    <h1>Planning your page</h1>
    <p>When you create a webpage, it is important to think of the hierarchy of the content. Many web designers engage in a practice called <em>wireframing</em>. This is useful for designers to determine the layout of a page and how people will interact with the page. Ultimately, it's a way of describing information contained in elements in a logical order, and giving some thought to the experience of the user. What is the goal of your website? What information is most important? In what order should the information be presented? What are the steps required and what types of interactions should be included? In addition to answering these questions for yourself, asking other people helps a lot with this process.</p>
